# THEME PARK HACK-A-THON

---

## Dates: 7/21/22 - 7/22/22

## Desription

#### This project was a collabotive effort between Jason Martinez, Patrick Knight, and Ryan Saucier. Assigned as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, this represents our first full-stack project: a day-and-a-half long hack-a-thon (or 'Fullstackathon') than saw us build a working full stack application from scratch in less than 2 days.
#### The prompt was to build a theme-park themed site, hence the RollerCoaster Tycoon theme. If you haven't ever played RollerCoaster Tycoon, I highly recommend that you try it out (see link below for one option).
